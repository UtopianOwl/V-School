This is a business website I designed for a fictional business named "Human Dwel", which sells sustainability oriented high end modular homes.
The images I used as well as the inspiration for the site comes from an existing company in that industry space, Blu Homes.
It was designed by Drew Nauman as part of the curriculum for the V-School full-stack web development bootcamp.

I chose a very simple layout design with a logo and font-style to match.
The page uses bootstrap 3 styling
The lightbox on the gallery page uses Fresco
The each page is fully responsive.
The nav box becomes a nav bar to accomodate more content on mobile screens.

Below is the original assignment:

Business Time
14 APRIL 2016 on Static Websites, Level 2, Project
You just decided to start a business. You know you need a website, but you're bootstrapping your business without external funding, so you can't pay someone else to do it.

The type of business doesn't really matter, so get creative with it. This will be a static website, so it doesn't require the use of any JavaScript. However, if you want to go above-and-beyond, you're welcome to include some JavaScript too.

Your site should be well-styled and should look good on mobile screens (that is, it should be responsive).

Project Requirements
Create a website for your new business that is well-styled, responsive, and includes at least the following items:

Inline/Block elements
Divs & spans
Images
List (navigation bar can count as a "list")
Headers/paragraphs
Semantic HTML (HTML 5 new tags)
CSS Box model alterations (margin, padding, border, width/height
Bootstrap grid system
Multiple HTML pages, linked
Passing Criteria: Class Demo
You'll be showing off your website and explaining your new business venture to the class. This demo will be short, probably only 1-2 minutes each.

This project passes off the following levels of the Skills Tree:
