This is a simple web application which allows users to add and remove items from a shopping list using a simple form.
It is intended to practice using jQuery to make a page dynamic as well as making the data input persist if the page is refreshed.

It was designed by Drew Nauman as part of the curriculum for the V-School full-stack web development bootcamp.

the original assignment is below:

# Mother's Shopping List
18 MAY 2015 on Web Applications, Level 1, Project

Your mother is frustrated by her propensity to lose slips of paper with writing on them, specifically her shopping lists. She knows that you're a really smart web developer and assumes that you can easily make her a website to keep track of her shopping list.

### Project Requirements
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and optionally jQuery), write a simple shopping list app. There must be an input box to add new items, and an [x] button to delete items. The data does not have to persist a page refresh (because there's no API right now).

Here's what the list might look like:

You should be able to delete items by clicking the [x]:

### Passing criteria: Demo to an instructor or TA

An instructor or TA will sit with you for a demonstration of this project. They will be assessing your proficiency in the following areas:
*Difference between web app and web site
*Build very basic web apps (site is functional and based on user interaction)
*Understand JSON

Passing off this project completes the Web Applications, Level 1 branch of the skills tree.

##### Extra Credit

Use localStorage or sessionStorage to save the list in case the page is refreshed.
